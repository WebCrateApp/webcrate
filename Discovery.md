## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

WebCrate helps you organize links, articles and more from around the web in a central place. You can add links from any device or directly from the browser using a Firefox/Chrome extension and organize them into different collections called crates. Share crates with anyone or subscribe to crates by other users to stay up to date.

- **Easy to use**: Minimal, focused and intuitive interface
- **Customizable**: Add your own context to each link and use emojis to distinguish crates
- **Sharing**: Share your links and crates with the world
- **Cross Platform**: Install as PWA and use Browser Extensions
- **Private**: WebCrate runs on [Deta Space](https://deta.space), a new personal cloud
